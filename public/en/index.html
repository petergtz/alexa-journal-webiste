<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>My Journal</strong> allows you to write journal entries using <a href="https://amazon.com/b?node=21576558011">Amazon Alexa</a>. Entries can be made for the current day or for previous days. You can also search past entries. All that is needed is a device with Alexa, such as an Amazon Echo, and a Google account. The journal is saved as a table with the name <code>Journal</code> in Google Drive and can be manually edited at any time.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The <strong>My Journal</strong> Alexa skill, hereafter referred to as <strong>My Journal</strong>, processes <em>Google account user tokens</em>. By agreeing to &ldquo;link  <strong>My Journal</strong> and the user&rsquo;s Google account&rdquo; in the Amazon Alexa app, the user agrees that the Alexa service can request Google account user tokens via Google OAuth and pass them on to <strong>My Journal</strong>, which allows <strong>My Journal</strong> to see, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files the user uses with <strong>My Journal</strong> <em>and</em> also see, edit, create, and delete <em>all</em> of the user&rsquo;s Google Sheets spreadsheets. <strong>My Journal</strong> uses the token <em>only</em> to create, see, and edit a Google spreadsheet file called <code>Journal</code> in the user&rsquo;s Google Drive. The tokens are not stored anywhere or used otherwise and are discarded after each request.</p>
<p>Journal entries are entered by users themselves using Alexa voice input. Entries are then sent to Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa service and passed on from there to <strong>My Journal</strong>, which is hosted in Amazon AWS Lambda. From there, they are sent to Google&rsquo;s Spreadhseet API and persisted in the <code>Journal</code> spreadsheet in Google Drive. A <code>Journal</code> spreadsheet uses one line for each entry in which the date and text of the entry is saved, as well as the current timestamp.</p>
<p>A user&rsquo;s journal entries can also be retrieved. After a user has identified which entries should be retrieved, journal entries from <strong>My Journal</strong> are retrieved from the <code>Journal</code> spreadhseet in Google Drive and passed on to Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa service, which in turn sends them to the user&rsquo;s Alexa device where they are spoken out by Alexa.</p>
<p><strong>My Journal</strong> persists users' journal entries exclusively in the linked Google account under the file <code>Journal</code> in Google Drive. No further storage takes place. For more information on how Amazon Alexa processes this data, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V">here</a>.</p>
<p>A user&rsquo;s journal entries are never shared with other users or otherwise made available to third parties. Of course, a user can choose to use the functions of Google Drive to share a <code>Journal</code> spreadsheet with other Google Drive users or to make it public.</p>
<p>A <code>Journal</code> spreadsheet can be edited or deleted by the user at any time using Google&rsquo;s own Google Docs user interface.</p>
<p>The use of Google user data other than that specified above excplicitly does not take place.</p>
